# About this fork

Quick sim of the Pork Pie roundabout (Hinckley, UK). Full credit for the
engine goes to Jan Blaha's [Sketchbook](https://jblaha.art/sketchbook/latest)
— this is just a fork with a custom scenario.

What I did:
- Ripped the 3D model GLB off Google Earth Pro (via RenderDoc) for the
  roundabout and surrounding buildings.
- Captured satellite imagery via EarthRipper and used it as the ground
  texture in earlier iterations.
- Generated a heightmap collision floor from the model's geometry so the
  car drives on terrain that follows the actual road elevation instead
  of a flat plane. Sampled on a 10m grid, taking the top of the lowest 1m
  of geometry per cell so the car sits on the road surface.
- Patched `World.ts` to disable the demo's out-of-bounds respawn (the
  captured terrain is below the demo's hardcoded sea level).

Build scripts are in `custom_map/`. The captured 3D model is imported as
render-only geometry; the heightmap is a single trimesh collider.

# Final update (20. Feb 2023)

As I have no more interest in developing this project, it comes to a conclusion. In order to remain honest about the true state of the project, I am archiving this repository.

- If you wish to modify Sketchbook feel free to fork it.

# 📒 Sketchbook

Simple web based game engine built on [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) and [cannon.js](https://github.com/schteppe/cannon.js) focused on third-person character controls and related gameplay mechanics.

Mostly a playground for exploring how conventional third person gameplay mechanics found in modern games work and recreating them in a general way.

## Features

* World
	* Three.js scene
	* Cannon.js physics
	* Variable timescale
	* Frame skipping
	* FXAA anti-aliasing
* Characters
	* Third-person camera
	* Raycast character controller with capsule collisions
	* General state system
	* Character AI
* Vehicles
	* Cars
	* Airplanes
	* Helicopters

All planned features can be found in the [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/swift502/Sketchbook/projects).

## Usage

You can define your own scenes in Blender, and then read them with Sketchbook. Sketchbook needs to run on a local server such as [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) or [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) to be able to load external assets.

<!-- #### Script tag -->

1. Import:

```html
<script src="sketchbook.min.js"></script>
```

2. Load a glb scene defined in Blender:

```javascript
const world = new Sketchbook.World('scene.glb');
```

<!--

#### NPM

1. Install:

```
npm i sketchbook
```

2. Import:

```javascript
import { World } from 'sketchbook';
```

3. Load a glb scene defined in Blender:

```javascript
const world = new World('scene.glb');
```
